## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

.darken-img {
    filter: brightness(0.89) contrast(1.15);
}

The above caught me the first time I submitted this component. I'm personally used to editing images in Adobe products or similar, so editing a photo in code was novel for me. I am familiar with the concept of filtering, but I did have to fiddle with the amount of brightness/contrast in order to achieve the effect I was going for.
